separate, combine and manage feeds from your social media.
now, I'm new to github so... if I'm doing it wrong then say so; however it is you do so on github.
the MVP for this project is taking your current twitter feed where you may follow various types of content and splitting it into separate feeds as a way to group, for example, artists you follow into one feed, gamers into another, so on and so forth. eventually you'll be able to group feeds from different social media websites like instagram, facebook, tumblr. the end goal being to format and unify feeds from everywhere into a digestable format like how flipboard does for news.
